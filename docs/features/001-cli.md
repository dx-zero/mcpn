# MCPN CLI Tool Requirements

## Overview

The MCPN CLI tool will transform our existing MCP server into a command-line interface that enables users to easily initialize and configure workflows in their projects. The CLI will provide a seamless way to set up the necessary configuration files and import workflow presets based on the user's development environment.

## Core Commands

### `npx mcpn`

- **Purpose**: Run the MCP server by default
- **Behavior**:
  - When invoked without any commands (init, add, remove), run the MCP server
  - When invoked with specific commands, execute the requested command without starting the server

### `npx mcpn init`

- **Purpose**: Initialize the MCP configuration in the current project directory
- **Behavior**:
  - Present an interactive CLI interface with welcome message and tool description
  - Prompt user to select their IDE from options (Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Roocode, etc.)
  - Create a `.mcp-workflows` folder in the current directory
  - Generate an `mcp-config.js` file with the selected IDE configuration
  - Set up appropriate MCP server configuration files based on the selected IDE
- **Options**:
  - Support for non-interactive mode via flags:
    - `--headless`: Configure for non-IDE environment (create an mcpn directory in the user's documents directory and .mcp-workflows directory in the mcpn directory - so mcpn/.mcp-workflows; it then uses that as the path for our --config flag; create mcp-config.js file with an IDE of "headless")
    - `--cursor`, `--windsurf`, `--cline`, `--roocode`, etc.: Directly specify IDE without interactive prompting in the CLI

### `npx mcpn add [preset]` or `npx mcpn i [preset]`

- **Purpose**: Add predefined workflow presets to the project
- **Behavior**:
  - Copy the specified preset YAML file into the `.mcp-workflows` folder
  - If the `.mcp-workflows` folder doesn't exist, display a warning and run the initialization flow
  - Support for built-in presets (e.g., `npx mcpn add coding`)
- **Validation**:
  - Verify that the specified preset exists
  - Handle conflicts if a preset with the same name already exists

### `npx mcpn add [URL]` or `npx mcpn i [URL]`

- **Purpose**: Add third-party workflow presets from external sources
- **Behavior**:
  - Fetch YAML files from specified URLs (e.g., `npx mcpn add "https://mywebsite.com/thinking_mode.yaml"`)
  - Save the fetched YAML file to the `.mcp-workflows` folder
  - Perform validation on the downloaded YAML to ensure it's properly formatted
- **Security**:
  - Implement basic validation for external YAML files
  - Warn users about potential risks of importing external configurations

### `npx mcpn remove [name]`, `npx mcpn uninstall [name]`, or `npx mcpn rm [name]`

- **Purpose**: Remove specific workflows or entire preset files
- **Behavior**:
  - When provided with a workflow name:
    - Remove only that specific workflow from its YAML file
    - If it's the only workflow in the file, offer to remove the entire file
  - When provided with a preset name:
    - Remove the entire YAML file for that preset
  - When provided with a URL:
    - Find and remove the YAML file that was installed from that URL
- **Conflict Resolution**:
  - If a name conflicts between a workflow and a preset (e.g., both "coding" workflow and "coding" preset exist):
    - Display prompt: "We found both a 'coding' preset and a 'coding' workflow. Which would you like to remove?"
    - Provide two options via radio buttons navigable with arrow keys:
      1. "Delete 'coding' preset (entire YAML file)"
      2. "Delete 'coding' workflow (specific workflow only)"
    - Take appropriate action based on selection
- **Validation**:
  - Verify that the specified workflow or preset exists before attempting removal
  - Provide clear feedback on successful removal

## Configuration Structure

### `.mcp-workflows` Directory

- Central location for all workflow configurations
- Contains the MCP configuration file and workflow preset YAML files

### `mcp-config.js` File

- Exports a configuration object with IDE-specific settings
- Basic structure:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  ide: "cursor", // or other IDE option
  // Additional configuration options can be added here
};
```

## IDE-Specific Integration

### Cursor Integration

- Configuration format:

To setup our MCP server in Cursor, we need to add the following to a new or existing mcp.json file within a ".cursor" directory. If mcp.json already exists, we can add it as a new object under mcpServers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcpn": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcpn@latest", "--config path/to/.mcp-workflows"]
    }
  }
}
```

Do not override existing mcp.json files, just add the new object under mcpServers.
Do not modify existing server definitions within mcpServers object, just add the new "mcpn" one.
Check to see if mcpn already exists in our json and if so, make sure it has the correct args. Just override the args if they are not correct.

Make sure to replace the "--config path/to/.mcp-workflows" to the actual path to the .mcp-workflows directory in our project.

### Support for Cline & Roocode IDE

The same kind of JSON file for Cline users can be found here: `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`

Do the same thing as the above Cursor example but for this `cline_mcp_settings.json` file.

### Support for Windsurf IDE

The same kind of JSON file for Windsurf users can be found here: `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`

Do the same thing as the above Cursor example but for this `mcp_config.json` file.

## Conflict Resolution

### Workflow Name Conflicts

- **Detection**:
  - When installing a new template, check for existing workflows with the same name
  - Compare the top-most parameter in the YAML file (workflow name)
  - If a name parameter exists in the YAML, use that for comparison
  - If both the top parameter and name parameter match, consider it a duplicate
- **Resolution UI**:
  - Display prompt: "Existing workflow found with the same name. Would you like to:"
  - Provide two options via radio buttons navigable with arrow keys:
    1. "Rename existing workflow"
    2. "Provide a unique name for incoming workflow"
  - Based on selection, prompt for the new name
  - For existing workflow: Update the name parameter in the existing YAML
  - For incoming workflow: Add a name parameter to the incoming YAML
- **File Name Conflicts**:
  - If YAML filenames are identical, automatically append a suffix to the incoming file
  - Use format: `original_name-001.yaml` or `original_name_001.yaml`
  - No user prompt required for filename conflicts

## Error Handling

- Provide clear error messages when commands fail
- Implement graceful fallbacks when prerequisites are not met
- Guide users through troubleshooting steps when issues occur

## Additional Notes:

So just a few additional things to consider. We do want to make sure that we make it so that when you do npx mcpn without an init add or remove command, it still runs the mcp server. Right? If you don't pass any of those commands that we defined above, it should just by default run the mcp server. And if we do pass in any of those commands, it should not run the mcp server, but instead run the logic that we've demonstrated above through our CLI tool.

When installing a new template, we do need to make sure that there aren't any existing templates within our .mcp workflows within any of the YAML files within our .mcp workflows folder that have the same name. And if there are any, then we should prompt the user in the CLI to say, hey, existing workflow found with the same name. Would you like to rename the existing one or provide a unique name for the incoming workflow? And then that'll be like a kind of like a like two radio buttons or whatever, like that the user can can use the arrow arrows on their keyboard and hit enter to choose. And then once they choose, we then prompt them for the new name for either the existing workflow or for the incoming workflow. Yeah, I think that'll be I think that would be best. And that's really just for like the workflow names of the tool names, right? Like in our YAML file, like the top, the top most parameter is like the name of the workflow. So that's what needs to be unique. Right. And then if they do pass in something unique there or if they do have to change it, we just add it as a name parameter, not like change the actual like name of the YAML file there. But yeah, so we just want to like make sure that when we're looking for the same names that we're looking to see, OK, like is the top most parameter the same? OK, if so, then just double check to see if there's a name parameter. And if there isn't, then assume they're the same. But if there is a name parameter, check that too to make sure to make sure that they're not the same. But if that's also the same, then, you know, obviously they're a duplicate or they're the same basically. So that's another thing we have to consider. And then let's not and then also like if the file, the YAML file names are the same, then don't ask the user about it. Just append the incoming YAML file with some kind of number at the end. Like we could say like, you know, zero zero one or something at the very end, like underscore zero zero one or dash zero zero one, I think would work fine too.
