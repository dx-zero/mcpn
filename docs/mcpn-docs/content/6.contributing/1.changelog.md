This file contains an overview of significant changes and new features for each version.

## v0.1.0
- Initial alpha release of MCPN CLI
- Basic commands: init, add, config
- Example presets: coding, thinking, github

## v0.2.0 (Unreleased)
- Improvements to CLI prompts
- Additional tests and bug fixes
- **User-Defined Presets:** Users can now create custom tool presets by adding new `.yaml` definition files within their local configuration directory (`.mcp-workflows` or the path specified via `--config`). These custom presets can then be activated using the `--preset <custom-preset-name>` flag, enabling personalized tool collections alongside built-in ones.
- **Preset Overrides:** Allow user-defined preset YAML files to override built-in presets when they share the same name.

Stay tuned for future updates in this space as MCPN evolves!
