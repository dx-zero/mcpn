We're using `pnpm` with a monorepo setup. 

# Prerequisites

1. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)



# Run local MCPN server

```
pnpm run build
```

Add this to `.cursor/mcp.json`

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"workflows-mcp": {
			"command": "node",
			"args": [
				"./packages/cli/bin/mcpn.mjs server"
			]
		}
	}
}

```
